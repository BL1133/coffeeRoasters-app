# Coffeeroasters Subscription Site

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This project was an exciting journey to build a multi-page coffee subscription website aimed at delivering the best possible user experience. The site features a dynamic "Create Your Plan" page that guides users through selecting their perfect coffee subscription package.

### Features

Users can interact with the subscription page in several ways to customize their coffee subscription:

- Dynamic selection process for creating a coffee plan.
- Disabled sections based on previous choices, enhancing user experience.
- Order summary modal that updates based on selections.
- Price calculation per shipment and per month based on selected options.

### Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the interactive UI components.
- **Sass**: For advanced styling and layout optimizations.
- **Deployed on Vercel**: For seamless hosting and deployment.

### Expected Behaviour

- **Capsule Selection**: Disables the grind option and updates the order summary text accordingly.
- **Filter or Espresso Selections**: Enables grind selection and updates the order summary.
- **Price Updates**: Depending on the weight selected, the price per shipment and per month cost are dynamically updated.

### Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BL1133/coffeeRoasters-app.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd coffeeroasters-subscription-site
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash

```

4. Start the development server:

The site should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Challenges and Learnings

Developing the "Create Your Plan" feature was both challenging and rewarding, requiring sophisticated state management to handle the complex user decision process. Initially, the logic started simple but expanded to accommodate various user scenarios. This process underscored the importance of planning and the potential for refining code to enhance functionality and user experience.
